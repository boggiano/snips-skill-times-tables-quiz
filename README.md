# Times Tables Quiz

## Intro:

This is a simple game demoing the dialog features of the snips platform.

You can ask the voice assistant to start a new game with a given number of questions and the table you want to learn.

The assistant will then ask you questions one by one and will tell you when you're right or wrong.

You can find further info about this game in the official Snips documentation [here](https://docs.snips.ai/articles/platform/multi-turn-dialog)

## Standard Installation:

Go to your snips console and create an assistant. In this assistant add the snips official times tables app.

If you have the snips platforme already installed you are now able to install your assistant with [sam](https://snips.gitbook.io/getting-started/installation).

First run `sam connect` to connect to your raspberry.

Then run `sam install assistant` and choose the assistant you just created.

You can now challenge yourself on your times tables !
